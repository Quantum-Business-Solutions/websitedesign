# Design references

Sites worth drawing on. Entry shape is fixed by `design/SCHEMA.md` — conform to it so entries stay
comparable. Hand-editing is fine and expected; you don't need Claude, a server, or a database.

Where a `tokens:` line is present, those values were **measured** off the live page. Everything in
the prose is judgement. Keep the judgement specific: name the move, not the mood.

---

## Linear

- **url:** https://linear.app
- **tokens:** `design/tokens/linear.json`
- **tags:** minimal, dark-mode, restrained-motion, product-led
- **category:** SaaS product marketing

The reference point for restrained dark product marketing: near-black ground, a single indigo link
accent, almost no decoration — hierarchy carried entirely by type weight and spacing. The detail
worth stealing is the radius tension: 2px on surfaces against fully-rounded buttons, so the pills
read as a decision rather than a global setting.

## Stripe

- **url:** https://stripe.com
- **tokens:** `design/tokens/stripe.json`
- **tags:** trust-first, light-ground, single-accent, enterprise
- **category:** B2B fintech / trust-first

How to look credible to a procurement panel without looking dull: white ground, near-black text,
one confident indigo reserved for links and the primary CTA. Söhne rather than a system sans is a
large part of why it reads bespoke instead of bootstrapped.

## Orbit Media Studios

- **url:** https://www.orbitmedia.com
- **tokens:** `design/tokens/orbitmedia.json`
- **tags:** agency-peer, warm-accent, condensed-headings, credibility-first
- **category:** Consulting / professional services

The closest live peer to QBS's own positioning — a Chicago web design and digital marketing agency.
Warm brick accent instead of default tech blue, condensed headings against a regular body face, and
a 4px base unit that runs tighter than the usual 8px agency template. The most directly applicable
reference here for QBS client homepages.

## Vercel

- **url:** https://vercel.com
- **tokens:** `design/tokens/vercel.json`
- **tags:** monochrome, type-led, tailwind, developer-audience
- **category:** Developer platform marketing

Carries the whole page on type and a near-black accent (`#171717`) with essentially no color — the
64px/56px scale against 16px body does the work. Useful proof that "no color" is a viable direction
rather than a missing decision. Built on Tailwind with a 4px base unit.

Two measured values to read carefully: the button radius came back as `33554400px`, which is a
browser-computed artifact meaning "fully rounded" rather than a usable token — treat it as
`9999px`. And the captured `link: #9A050F` (dark red) doesn't match the site's visible link
treatment; it's likely an incidental or state-specific capture. The `accent` and `background` are
the trustworthy reads here.

## Basecamp

- **url:** https://basecamp.com
- **tokens:** `design/tokens/basecamp.json`
- **tags:** text-forward, warm, opinionated-voice, high-body-size
- **category:** B2B SaaS, voice-led

The counterexample to screenshot-forward SaaS: no product chrome in the hero, just an argument in
large type. The 20px body size is the notable decision — nearly a third larger than the 15–16px
default, which is what makes long-form copy on a B2B page actually readable. Blue primary with a
green secondary, on a barely-tinted blue-white ground rather than pure white.

Type sizes came back fractional (`55.87px`, `20.32px`) because the site uses a fluid/responsive
scale — those are the values at the measured viewport, not authored numbers. Read them as ratios.

## GOV.UK

- **url:** https://www.gov.uk
- **tokens:** `design/tokens/gov.json`
- **tags:** accessibility-first, zero-radius, high-contrast, public-sector
- **category:** Public service / clarity extreme

The clarity extreme, and valuable precisely as a counterweight: `0px` radius everywhere, `#0B0C0C`
on white, 19px body, and a green primary action that never competes with anything else on the page.
When a client's audience is genuinely broad or the content is genuinely procedural, this is the
register — and it's a reminder that most "sophisticated" styling is optional.

The `link: #FFDD00` capture is real and worth knowing: that yellow is GOV.UK's focus-state
highlight, one of the most-copied accessibility patterns in web design. It's a focus color, not a
link color.

# Technique references

Visual techniques rather than site designs — illustration style, motion, composition. These carry no
`tokens:` line: the `branding` extractor reads CSS, so it has nothing to say about a 3D render. The
prose *is* the reference here, which means it has to be specific enough to brief or build against.

## Isometric modular ring — "connection" made literal

- **source:** Dribbble concept shot, "Tikit Connect 3D Illustrations" — Tarik Parwizi / Wig Thing
  Limited. Credited, not stored; see the sourcing rules in `design/guardrails.md`.
- **tokens:** none — illustration technique, nothing measurable
- **tags:** isometric-3d, modular, connection-metaphor, dimensional-render
- **category:** Hero illustration / brand metaphor

Chunky isometric blocks arranged in a closed ring, each face carrying a mark or label, rendered with
soft studio lighting and real material weight — matte dark surfaces, subtle bevels, contact shadows
between modules. The whole point is that the *composition* argues the message: discrete parts that
only make sense interlocked. It diagrams connection instead of illustrating it.

Two honest caveats:

- **Nothing ships this.** Searching for a live site using it turns up only galleries and stock. Tikit
  itself was absorbed into OneAdvanced, so even this concept likely never shipped. A style with no
  production examples is either expensive to execute at quality or doesn't survive real page
  constraints — budget for a real 3D render, not a CSS approximation.
- **Technique vs. copy.** Isometric modular composition is common visual language and fair to work
  in. Reproducing *this specific* arrangement, palette, and render treatment for a paid client
  deliverable is a different thing. Take the structural idea; don't rebuild the frame.

### Applied idea: Nexus

Logged because it's the reason this got saved and the idea shouldn't evaporate. Nexus positions as
*"one idea, one plan: Nexus is the connection"* — so a ring of interlocking modules with **their
service lines on the outer faces** makes the positioning literally visible: separate offerings, one
connected system, nothing detachable without breaking the ring. Strong fit for the hero, and it
gives the "not just another MSP" line something structural to stand on rather than asserting it in
copy alone.

## Candidates not yet adopted

Two review boards were assembled earlier and never approved into this list — 18 references by page
type (pricing, dashboard, proposal, case study, team, blog, contact) and 10 by aesthetic family
(award-winning, minimal, brutalist, dark, maximalist). They live as published artifacts, not in this
repo. To adopt any of them, find the design's **live site**, drop it in `design/inbox.md`, and run
`/design-ingest`. See the sourcing section of `design/guardrails.md` for why the gallery images
themselves aren't stored here.
